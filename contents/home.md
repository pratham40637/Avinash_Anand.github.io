**Research Interests:**  
Natural Language Processing; Large Language Models (LLM pre-training, alignment, and multilingual systems); Multimodal LLMs for accident detection and medical imaging; Multimodal generative AI.

My research focuses on **building large-scale LLM pre-training pipelines**, spanning **kernel-level optimization**, **ultra-scale GPU parallelism**, and **algorithmic innovations** such as **FlashAttention-4**, as well as **post-training methods including GRPO**. I aim to advance **robust, efficient, and scalable LLM and multimodal systems** that integrate **text and vision** for generalized reasoning and real-world deployment.

My work spans **LLM architectures, optimization, and task-specific model development**, with an emphasis on **multilingual, cross-lingual, and mathematical reasoning capabilities**. I also explore **multimodal mental health detection** and **vision-based applications**, including **road accident detection, traffic analysis, and maritime tracking**. Overall, my goal is to design **impactful AI systems** that advance **healthcare, transportation, and software engineering**, while meaningfully improving **quality of life**.
